- 🔭 I have been working on a few personal projects with JavaScript/React. Currently, I have returned to my first love and started to refresh my Python skills with some simple projects, diving into Pygame and building my own wordle game.
- 🔥 My 2021 Hacktoberfest contribution: I contributed to the open source Women Who've Changed Tech 👩‍💻 project. This open source project aims to collect and share the history of Female Tech Pioneers, building a website and API to make this information freely available.
- 👩‍💻 💪 My most recent projects are: a memory game app called [Memory Crunch](https://jethet-memory-game.netlify.app/), built with React and deployed on Netlify, and an app for [Unexpected Chats](https://jethet-unexpected-chat-app.netlify.app/), for when you are bored or just want to talk to someone ... something. This was built with vanilla JS and also deployed on Netlify.

These projects aim to offer challenges to starting students, more advanced students and graduates.
