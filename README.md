- 🔭 I am currently working on a few personal projects: a library app called BoundlessBooks (Node.js, Express, React and PostgreSQL), and a tic-tac-toe game (of course): one version in the terminal with Node.js, and one version with React. The Node.js version can be played in the terminal using `prompt` to get input from the console and use this in the game dynamically.
- 🔥 My 2021 Hacktoberfest contribution: I contributed to the open source Women Who've Changed Tech 👩‍💻 project. This open source project aims to collect and share the history of Female Tech Pioneers, building a website and API to make this information freely available.
- 👩‍💻 💪 My most recent projects are: a memory game app called [Memory Crunch](https://jethet-memory-game.netlify.app/), built with React and deployed on Netlify, and an app for [Unexpected Chats](https://jethet-unexpected-chat-app.netlify.app/), for when you are bored or just want to talk to someone ... something. This was built with vanilla JS.
- :raising_hand: I am creating various small projects and other teaching material for the monthly [CodeWomen](https://migracode.openculturalcenter.org/codewomen) coding sessions, for students to work on.
