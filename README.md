- 🔭 I am currently working on a few personal projects: a library app called BoundlessBooks, a tic-tac-toe game (of course): one version in the terminal with Node.js, and one version with React. The terminal version uses prompt to get input from the console and use this in the game dynamically.
- 🔥 I am contributing to the open source Adoptium.net project, working on improving their website together with a team of volunteers.
- 👩‍💻 💪 My most recent projects are: a memory game app called [Memory Crunch](https://jethet-memory-game.netlify.app/), built with React and deployed on Netlify, and an app for [Unexpected Chats](https://jethet-funny-chat.netlify.app/), when you are bored or just want to talk to someone ... something. This was built with vanilla JS.
- :raising_hand: I am creating various small projects and other teaching material for the monthly [CodeWomen](https://migracode.openculturalcenter.org/codewomen) coding sessions, for students to work on. These projects aim to offer challenges to starting students, more advanced students and graduates.
- 🌱 I am currently learning more about React, especially React Hooks, and about deploying a project with a database
- :computer: I am an instructor and project manager at [Migracode](https://migracode.openculturalcenter.org). The projects I manage are: a) the **CodeWomen** project (have a look at the 💪 👩🏽‍💻 [CodeWomen GitHub organisation](https://github.com/CodeWomen-Barcelona) 👩‍💻 🔥); and b) the **CodeBuddies** project 
- In addition, I am a member of the Syllabus Team at Migracode that is responsible for the continuous review and update of the teaching material
