- 🔭 I have been working on a few personal projects with JavaScript/React. But some time ago, I have returned to my first love and started to refresh my Python skills with some simple projects, diving into Pygame and building my own wordle game.
- 🔥 My 2021 Hacktoberfest contribution: I contributed to the open source Women Who've Changed Tech 👩‍💻 project. This open source project aims to collect and share the history of Female Tech Pioneers, building a website and API to make this information freely available.
- 👩‍💻 💪 My last projects are: a memory game app called [Memory Crunch](https://jethet-memory-game.netlify.app/), built with React and deployed on Netlify, and an app for [Unexpected Chats](https://jethet-unexpected-chat-app.netlify.app/), for when you are bored or just want to talk to someone ... something. This was built with vanilla JS and also deployed on Netlify.
